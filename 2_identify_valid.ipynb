    "# Identify Valid Grids (The Safety Margin)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Refinement: You must acknowledge that your ML model's predictions are imperfect. Instead of identifying grids predicted >0.75, you must use a Safety Margin to ensure validity.\n",
    "* Key Action: Filter for grids predicted significantly above the threshold (e.g., > 0.85). Use your first few submissions to calibrate this margin. If you submit 100 grids predicted > 0.85 and only 95 are valid, your true safe threshold is higher."
